# OlympicBase
 
This project helps us to understand the database management system by using Olympic 
database as an example and implementing the technologies like MySQL, HTML, CSS, and 
so on. We are trying to build a website which will display all the Olympic related facts and 
user can access the same. The admin has the privilege to update and modify the website 
referring the latest information. Our website will help the user to get better understanding 
of Olympic games. User can access the results of all sports held, countryâ€™s participation, 
total budget for hosting and so on.
